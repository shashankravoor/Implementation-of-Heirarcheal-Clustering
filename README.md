# Implementation-of-Heirarcheal-Clustering

Implemented the heirarcheal clustering algorithm of type complete linkage by considering different cases like: 

                    1. Finding the euclidean distance between 1D list from a point P and choosing the point having maximum distance. 
                    2. Intra points euclidean distance calculation by using 1D list and finding the pair of points having maximum distance. 
                    3. Finding the euclidean distance between two 1D list and finding the pair of points having maximum distance.
                    4. Finding euclidean distance between 2D list from a point P and finding the pair of points having maximum distance. 
                    5. Finding euclidean distance between two 2D list and finding the pair of points having maximum distance.
